"""Run the worked example in CONTRIBUTING.md through the real validator.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The "Required shape" section of CONTRIBUTING.md shows a filer a
complete crosswalk and tells them to build one like it. On 2026-08-30 that
example was checked against the validator for the first time and failed with
three errors: `system_url`, `crosswalk_version` and `vocabulary_version_targeted`
were all missing, and `system` was a block where the validator wants a string.
The template beside it validated cleanly, so the defect was confined to the
guide's own prose.

Four frontier models read that file across two adversarial rounds and none of
them found it, which is the useful part. They were reading the document. The
defect only appears when somebody DOES what the document says. A guide is a
claim about what happens when its instructions are followed, and the only way to
check that claim is to follow them.

So this extracts the example from the markdown, writes it into `crosswalk/` under
a name the validator will pick up, and runs the validator exactly as CI does. No
reimplementation of any rule: if the validator changes, this follows.

Exit 0 the example validates, 1 it does not, 2 the check could not run.
